### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Natalie, a Linux system / devops engineer experienced in developing infrastructure-as-code solutions and operations automation.  I'm also the lead admin for GitHub Enterprise at my employer, Booz Allen Hamilton.

I work a lot with
- GitHub Enterprise
- Kubernetes
- Python
- RunDeck
- but mostly, I work with people on all of the above!

I play with
- I play some video games on a Windows 10 VM on my Fedora desktop with libvirt and a custom Linux kernel to pass hardware to it.  It's pretty neat and has about 5% or so performance drop (just looking at frame rates).  You should check it out [here](https://github.com/Somersall-Natalie/fedora-acs-override).
- All sorts of handy Raspberry Pi projects, including a Kodi set up on a television for local media and a Kubernetes cluster that runs
  - [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), for DNS and ad-blocking
  - Ubiquiti UniFi network application
  - [Home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), I'm just getting started with a few smart dimmers, but there's so much cool stuff here!
- I have an awesome life outside of tech, so while I have a few projects that I enjoy (:point_up:), nothing above is close to where I spend most of my time / energy.  If you need anything in the above fixed, please feel free to fork it and send me a pull request! :heart:

Heads up!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on automating everything put in front of me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some Kubernetes admin and development basics.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: For work related stuff, please reach out by opening a support ticket in our internal IT systems.  For personal stuff, you should probably reach out the way you normally would.  :)
